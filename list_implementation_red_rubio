Python Lists

//text only*

Sequence is the most basic data structure in Python, Each element of a sequence is assigned a number - its position or index. The first index is zero, the second index is one, and so forth.

Python has six built-in types of sequences, but the most common ones are Lists and Tuples.

The list is a most versatile datatype available in Python which can be written as

a list of comma-separated values (items) between square brackets. Important thing about a list is that items in a list need not be of the same type.

Examples:

list1 = ['Java', 'Visual Basic', 1997, 2000];

list2 = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];

list3 = ["a", "b", "c", "d"];

1) Accessing Values in Lists

To access values in lists, use the square brackets for slicing along with the index.

Examples:

abc = ["Selenium", "UFT", "SilkTest", 100, 200, 300];

print (abc);

print (abc[1]);

2) Updating Lists

You can update single or multiple elements of lists by giving the slice on the

left-hand side of the assignment operator, and you can add to elements in a list

with the append() method.

Examples:

list = ['physics', 'chemistry', 1997, 2000];

print (list);

print (list[2]);

list[2] = 9999;

print (list);

print (list[2]);

3) Delete List Elements

To remove a list element, you can use either the del statement if you know exactly which element(s) you are deleting or the remove() method if you do not know.

Example:

list1 = ['physics', 'chemistry', 1997, 2000];

print (list1);

del (list1[2]);

print (list1);

4) Built-in List Functions & Methods / Operations on Python Lists

i) len()

Gives the total length of the list.

Example:

list = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];

print (len(list));

ii) max()

Returns item from the list with max value.

Example:

list = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];

print (max(list));

iii) min()

Returns item from the list with min value.

Example:

list = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];

print (min(list));

Methods with Description

i) append() method

Appends object obj to list

Example:

list = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];

print(list);

list.append(70);

print(list);

ii) remove() method

Removes element from list by element value.

Example:

list = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];

print(list);

list.remove(50);

print(list);

iii) reverse() method

Reverses elements of list in place

Example:

list = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];

print(list);

list.reverse();

print(list);
